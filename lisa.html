            <h2>About This Tool</h2>
  <p>The LISA Retirement Calculator is designed to help UK residents estimate how much their Lifetime ISA (LISA) savings could grow by the time they reach retirement age (60). By entering your current age, annual contribution (up to the £4,000 government limit), and an assumed annual interest rate, this tool provides an instant projection that includes both the 25% government bonus and the effects of annual compound interest.</p>

  <p>This calculator follows official UK government guidance on Lifetime ISAs <a href="https://www.gov.uk/lifetime-isa" target="_blank">[source]</a>, where individuals aged 18–39 can open a LISA and contribute until the age of 50. Contributions are topped up by a 25% bonus (up to £1,000 per year) and can be invested in cash or stocks & shares. If you're looking to open a LISA, a reputable provider like <a href="https://www.hl.co.uk/investment-services/lifetime-isa" target="_blank">Hargreaves Lansdown</a> offers competitive options and clear explanations for investors.</p>

  <h2>Alex’s Perspective:</h2> <p>Alex is always encouraging people to be more financially <em>savage</em> and strives to help friends, family, and associates become more financially literate. One way Alex does this is by explaining the benefits of investing in a Lifetime ISA (LISA). He developed this calculator to highlight the power of investing early—when time is on your side. Younger investors benefit from longer horizons, allowing their investments to recover from market downturns and accumulate more through the power of compound interest.</p>

  <h2>Choosing an Interest Rate:</h2> <p> For anyone using this tool who hasn't spoken with Alex directly, it's important to choose an appropriate annual interest rate when estimating your returns. As a rough guide, here are some common asset classes ordered by typical risk (from low to high), with approximate long-term annual return estimates:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Banking Current Account – ~0.01% to 0.5%</li>
    <li>Banking Savings Account – ~1% to 3%</li>
    <li>Government Bonds (e.g., UK Gilts) – ~2% to 4%</li>
    <li>Corporate Bonds – ~3% to 6%</li>
    <li>Private Equity (unlisted companies) – ~8% to 12%</li>
    <li>Individual Stocks – ~7% to 10% (higher variance)</li>
    <li>Funds (Mutual Funds & Index Trackers) – ~6% to 9%
      <ul>
        <li><strong>7.1</strong> Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (VUSA) – ~10%</li>
        <li><strong>7.2</strong> Fidelity Index World Fund – ~8%</li>
        <li><strong>7.3</strong> iShares Core FTSE 100 ETF – ~6%</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Cryptocurrency – Highly volatile; historically ~20%+, but can experience >90% loss</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Technical Details:</h2> 
  <p>The calculator simulates yearly contributions and applies the 25% government bonus for each year up to age 50. Compound interest is then applied annually through to age 60 using the interest rate you specify. This simplified model offers a clear and transparent approximation of potential LISA growth under consistent annual conditions.</p>
