      <h2>About This Tool</h2>
        <p>
          The LISA Retirement Calculator helps UK residents estimate how much their Lifetime ISA (LISA) savings could grow by the age of 60. 
          By entering your current age, annual contribution (up to the £4,000 limit), and an estimated annual interest rate, 
          the tool projects your final balance—including the 25% government bonus and compound interest.
        </p>
        
        <h2>ISA and LISA Rules Summary</h2>
        <p>
          ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts) are tax-efficient savings and investment accounts available to UK residents. 
          The Lifetime ISA (LISA) is a specialised type of ISA designed to help individuals save for either a first home or retirement.
        </p>
        
        <h3>General ISA Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Annual allowance (2024/25):</strong> £20,000 across all ISA types</li>
          <li><strong>ISA types:</strong> Cash ISA, Stocks & Shares ISA, Innovative Finance ISA, and Lifetime ISA</li>
          <li>You may contribute to multiple ISAs in a year, but only <strong>one of each type</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Tax-free:</strong> No income tax or capital gains tax on ISA savings or withdrawals</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Lifetime ISA (LISA) Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Available to individuals aged <strong>18 to 39</strong></li>
          <li>You can contribute until age <strong>50</strong></li>
          <li>Maximum annual contribution: <strong>£4,000</strong> (counts toward £20,000 total ISA allowance)</li>
          <li>Government bonus: <strong>25%</strong> added monthly (up to £1,000/year)</li>
          <li>Funds can be used to:
            <ul>
              <li>Buy your first home (up to £450,000)</li>
              <li>Withdraw after age 60</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Early withdrawal penalty of <strong>25%</strong> applies unless for first home, retirement (60+), or terminal illness</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why Use a LISA?</h2>
        <p>
          Taking full advantage of the LISA is one of the most effective ways for UK residents aged 18–39 to build tax-free retirement savings. 
          The 25% government bonus provides an instant and guaranteed return on contributions—equivalent to earning £1,000 annually on a £4,000 investment, before any interest or investment growth. 
          Unlike pensions, LISA withdrawals after age 60 are <strong>completely tax-free</strong> and do not count as income, which can reduce future tax liabilities. 
          For long-term savers, especially those using a stocks & shares LISA, compound growth over two or three decades can significantly amplify the government bonus, 
          making the LISA a uniquely powerful tool compared to standard ISAs or savings accounts. 
          For further detail, see official > <a href="https://www.gov.uk/lifetime-isa" target="_blank">government guidance</a> or reputable providers like > 
          <a href="https://www.hl.co.uk/investment-services/lifetime-isa" target="_blank">Hargreaves Lansdown</a>, which explain the full benefits of using your allowance early and consistently.

        <h2>Choosing an Interest Rate</h2>
        <p>If you're not sure what annual return to use, here’s a rough guide to typical long-term returns across common asset classes (ordered from lowest to highest risk):</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Current Accounts:</strong> ~0.01% – 0.5%</li>
          <li><strong>Savings Accounts:</strong> ~1% – 3%</li>
          <li><strong>Government Bonds (UK Gilts):</strong> ~2% – 4%</li>
          <li><strong>Corporate Bonds:</strong> ~3% – 6%</li>
          <li><strong>Funds (Index Trackers & Mutual Funds):</strong> ~6% – 10%
            <ul>
              <li>• Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (VUSA): ~10%</li>
              <li>• Fidelity Index World Fund: ~8%</li>
              <li>• iShares Core FTSE 100 ETF: ~6%</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Individual Stocks:</strong> ~7% – 10% (higher risk and volatility)</li>
          <li><strong>Private Equity:</strong> ~8% – 12% (illiquid, higher uncertainty)</li>
          <li><strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> Historically 20%+ returns possible, but highly volatile and prone to >90% drawdowns</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Alex’s Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          Alex is always encouraging people to be more financially <em>savage</em> and strives to help friends, family, and associates become more financially literate. 
          One way Alex does this is by explaining the benefits of investing in a Lifetime ISA (LISA). 
          Alex developed this calculator to highlight the power of investing early—when time is on your side. 
          Younger investors benefit from longer horizons, allowing their investments to recover from market downturns 
          and accumulate more through the power of compound interest.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Technical Details</h2> 
        <p>
          The calculator simulates yearly contributions and applies the 25% government bonus for each year up to age 50. 
          Compound interest is then applied annually through to age 60 using the interest rate you specify. 
          This simplified model offers a clear and transparent approximation of potential LISA growth under consistent annual conditions.
        </p>
