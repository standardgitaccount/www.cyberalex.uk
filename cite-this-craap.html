          Trust in information online is becoming increasingly difficult. Misreporting,
          selective editing, agenda-driven commentary and AI-generated misinformation have
          made it harder than ever to judge whether something is credible.
        </p>
        <p class="small text-secondary mb-0">
          Even long-established institutions have recently made serious errors — such as the BBC
          facing criticism for editing part of a political speech in a way that changed its meaning.
          Incidents like this highlight a broader truth: <strong>no single source is automatically
          authoritative anymore.</strong>  
          This CRAAP Policy exists to explain how information on CyberAlex is produced, what its
          limitations are, and how you should evaluate it.

  <!-- SECTION — INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Why a CRAAP Policy?</h2>
    <div class="small text-secondary">

      <p>
        The internet is saturated with conflicting claims, political spin, AI-generated articles,
        and content engineered for engagement rather than truth. Studies from Ofcom, the EU
        Digital Services Act transparency reports, and multiple academic papers all highlight the
        same trend: <strong>misinformation is now widespread, fast-moving, and increasingly difficult
        to detect.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        In this landscape, credibility cannot simply be inherited from reputation. Even respected
        news organisations, universities, government agencies and research bodies occasionally publish
        material that is incomplete, misleading, or later corrected. This does not make them “bad”
        sources — it simply means that <strong>critical evaluation is essential everywhere.</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="mb-0">
        The CRAAP framework (Credibility, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, Purpose) is a tool to help
        you assess whether information is trustworthy. This page adapts that framework to explain how
        CyberAlex content should be interpreted.
      </p>

    </div>
  </section>


  <!-- C — CREDIBILITY -->
  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Credibility</h2>
    <div class="small text-secondary">

      <p>
        Content on CyberAlex is written by me (Alex), based on academic qualifications, practical
        cybersecurity experience, and ongoing research. Where relevant, I cite external sources or
        include links so you can verify material independently.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-0">
        However — and this is important — <strong>you should never assume credibility solely because
        it is published here.</strong> Cross-check information where necessary, especially for
        academic or professional use.
      </p>

    </div>
  </section>


  <!-- R — RELEVANCE -->
  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Relevance</h2>
    <div class="small text-secondary">

      <p>
        Most content on CyberAlex relates to cybersecurity, risk, governance, motoring analysis,
        photography, or personal technical projects. Page titles are designed to accurately reflect
        content so you can quickly judge whether it is relevant to your needs.
      </p>

    </div>
  </section>


  <!-- A — AUTHORITY -->
  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Authority</h2>
    <div class="small text-secondary">
      <p>
        My authority comes from formal education (BSc Computer Security, MSc Cyber Security, Risk &
        Resilience), practical security work, and the academic writing I have produced.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-0">
        Still, <strong>I do not claim to be an ultimate authority.</strong>  
        Cybersecurity evolves rapidly, and new evidence or standards may supersede earlier
        assumptions. Treat CyberAlex as a knowledgeable contributor — one source among many.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>


  <!-- A — ACCURACY -->
  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Accuracy</h2>
    <div class="small text-secondary">

      <p>The accuracy of content varies by category:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formal documents</strong> follow referencing standards and aim for high accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical tools</strong> are transparent, client-side, and inspectable.</li>
        <li><strong>Blog posts</strong> may include personal perspective or evolving understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Photography and creative work</strong> are subjective by nature.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mb-0">
        Errors may occur; when identified, corrections will be made and documented in the page’s
        change log.
      </p>

    </div>
  </section>


  <!-- P — PURPOSE -->
  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Purpose</h2>
    <div class="small text-secondary">

      <p>The intent behind each type of content is different:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reports</strong> aim to educate or inform.</li>
        <li><strong>Tools</strong> aim to provide practical, transparent utility.</li>
        <li><strong>Affiliated sites</strong> each have their own stated purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Blog posts</strong> aim to share experience and insight.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mb-0">
        Across all of CyberAlex, the purpose is clarity, honesty and usefulness — not persuasion,
        monetisation or narrative shaping.
      </p>
