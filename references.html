    <h3>Credibility</h3>

    <h3>Authority</h3>

    <h3>Accuracy</h3>
    <p>
        The accuracy of content on Cyberalex varies depending on context, but as a general guide:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information in published documents is formal and based on other reports, documents, books, conference papers, and primary research. Alex strives to ensure that the information in these reports is as accurate as reasonably possible.</li>
        <li>Information on affiliated websites may vary. Some pages will be referenced, while others may not, depending on context.</li>
        <li>Information in the photography portfolio varies; while technical information is referenced and therefore formal, the overall outcome of the photography portfolio is considered art and is thus subjective.</li>
        <li>Information in blog posts is more informal and based on Alex's personal experiences or opinions (unless otherwise clearly referenced). With that in mind, blog posts can be considered primary sources of information, preferably backed up with another source.</li>
    </ul>
