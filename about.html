    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <section class="mb-5">
      <p class="lead mb-2">
        Alex is someone who likes understanding how things really work. That includes systems, policies, cars, cameras and sometimes coins. Curiosity tends to pull things together rather than apart, which is how this site ended up mixing cyber security, advanced driving, photography and a few practical tools.
      </p>
      <p class="small text-secondary mb-0">
        This page gives a clearer picture of what Alex works on and what matters along the way.

    <!-- CYBER SECURITY -->
    <section class="mb-5" aria-labelledby="cyber-heading">
      <h2 id="cyber-heading" class="h4 mb-3">Cyber Security, Risk and Resilience</h2>
      <div class="row g-4">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p class="small text-secondary">
            Alex studied Computer Security at undergraduate level and graduated with a First Class BSc. Postgraduate work in Cyber Security, Risk and Resilience builds on that foundation with a deeper focus on how organisations cope with real pressure. Not the tidy, theoretical kind, but the version where people miscommunicate, controls drift, systems fail at the wrong moment and someone has to make a decision before the damage spreads.
          </p>
          <p class="small text-secondary">
            The approach is simple. Look at people, technology and process as a system. Understand what is supposed to happen, then look at what actually happens. The gap between those two things is where most risk lives. Alex enjoys that work because it rewards clear reasoning, honesty about limitations and the ability to explain decisions so that others can build on them.
          </p>
          <p class="small text-secondary mb-0">
            Whether it is designing a practical tool, analysing a policy or modelling an incident, Alex aims to leave things clearer than they were found. Employers who value structured thinking, real awareness and the ability to communicate complex ideas usually find common ground here.

    <!-- AUTOMOTIVE -->
   <section class="mb-5" aria-labelledby="automotive-heading">
  <h2 id="automotive-heading" class="h4 mb-3">Automotive and Advanced Driving</h2>

  <div class="row g-4">

    <div class="col-lg-8">

      <p class="small text-secondary">
        What began as ordinary day-to-day driving slowly turned into something much more analytical. 
        Within two years of passing the test, Alex completed the IAM Advanced Test with a First, 
        followed by the IAM Masters. Examiners consistently highlighted calm planning, strong hazard 
        awareness, and a structured, methodical style.
      </p>

      <p class="small text-secondary">
        Progression into a rear-wheel-drive Jaguar and the High Performance Course introduced a more 
        technical layer. Pace, balance, vision, positioning, mechanical sympathy, each element became 
        something to study, refine and understand. The appeal lies in the process: breaking a complex 
        skill down, iterating, and finding the reasoning behind why something works.
      </p>

      <p class="small text-secondary mb-0">
        That mindset eventually led to 
        <a href="https://www.velosophy.org.uk" class="link-light">
          Velosophy
        </a> a separate site where the more 
        detailed write-ups live. It covers advanced driving, car control, the High Performance Course, 
        examiner feedback, and the broader philosophy behind driving well. If you appreciate driving as 
        a skill rather than just transport, it is worth a visit.

    <!-- PHOTOGRAPHY -->
    <section class="mb-5" aria-labelledby="photo-heading">
      <h2 id="photo-heading" class="h4 mb-3">Photography</h2>
      <div class="row g-4">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p class="small text-secondary">
              Photography was the career Alex wanted, but not one that was realistically affordable. Keeping it as a hobby turned out to be the better path. Without the pressure to make it pay, the focus shifted back to the simple things like light, timing, colour and the satisfaction of getting a frame to feel right.
            </p>

            <p class="small text-secondary">
              The results sometimes surprise people, occasionally to the point where they don’t believe the photos are Alex’s at all. It’s an awkward compliment, but a compliment nonetheless.
            </p>

            <p class="small text-secondary">
              Lumasphere is the dedicated portfolio. A cleaner space away from the tools and tech of CyberAlex. No features, no noise, just images presented simply. If you enjoy atmospheric, detail driven photography, it might be worth a look.
